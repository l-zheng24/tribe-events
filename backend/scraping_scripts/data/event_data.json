        "long_desc": "Hi Everyone! \n It\u2019s that time of year again; William & Mary\u2019s very own student hackathon, TribeHacks IX, returns to Swem Library from April 20 to April 21, 2024. Historically the event has been attended by as many as 400 students from William & Mary and other schools in the surrounding area. There are plenty of opportunities for students to get involved, especially those with a passion for technology like you.\n First of all, we\u2019re looking for students to lead workshops at the hackathon. The event is designed to accommodate all skill and experience levels, so we need a variety of workshops from absolute beginner to more advanced levels. If there\u2019s something you\u2019re passionate about, confident in, and/or interested in learning more about, please don\u2019t hesitate to sign up to lead a workshop here! \n\nSecond, our planning meetings are weekly in Tucker 222 from 6-7 PM on Mondays. This is a great time to ask questions or volunteer to help out on one or two of the many tasks that go into making this hackathon a rewarding experience for our attendees! We need day-of volunteers as well! Volunteers help pick up and set up the catered meals, answer attendee questions, and make sure that TribeHacks is a memorable experience for the attendees. Those who volunteered last year say that it was a highlight of their semester. If that sounds like something you\u2019d like to do, fill out this interest form!\n\nLastly (and certainly most importantly), we need attendees! Our website, tribehacks.com, is live and accepting registrations to attend the hackathon. Please talk to your friends, and whether they have no idea what Python is or have been programming for years, we\u2019d love for them to sign up to attend. We\u2019ll have plenty of team-building games, programming challenges, free food, and lots of awesome people to meet. There will also be a career fair where attendees can meet recruiters looking for people with technical skills to work for their companies. It\u2019s basically a giant Swem lock-in and will definitely be a weekend to remember.\n Aside from the fact that it is a ton of fun, a successful TribeHacks will have an array (no pun intended) of benefits for our CS department. A goal of TribeHacks this year is to make visible our identity as a Computer Science department at a liberal arts school, and all the unique benefits that identity brings to students. Student engagement in Computing and Data Science is super important in making sure William & Mary can continue to provide a great education in these in-demand areas for years to come. \n The TribeHacks planning team would appreciate any and all involvement you can put in to help make this event a success. We hope to see you on Mondays at 6 PM or on April 20th! Thanks for your time!\n Best,\nTribeHacks IX Planning Team\nSponsored by: Association for Computing Machinery, Developer Student Club at W&M, Robotics Club at William and Mary, and Society of Women in Computing"

        "event_date": "2024-04-22",
        "long_desc": "Abstract:\nOver the past decade, ubiquitous sensing has been increasingly explored as a viable means collect patient health data to improve how doctors can diagnose neurological disorders and diseases.  As machine learning methods continue to be improved by researchers from the computer science community, machine learning has seen a slower adoption by healthcare researchers to automatically detect and treat symptoms of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease. In this dissertation, I investigate how wearable computing and machine learning can be used to automatically detect and treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), freezing of gait (FoG) and hand tremors, in both real-time and offline settings.\n\nFirst, we designed a FoG detection and treatment system, FoG-Finder, which combines ubiquitous sensing, mobile computing, and machine learning to automatically detect and treat FoG symptoms in real-time. We first created time and frequency domain features using domain knowledge about how FoG symptoms manifest. Then, we used a multi-input convolutional neural network (CNN) model on a smartphone for real-time inference of FoG/non-FoG gait. To evaluate FoG-Finder, we collected data from 11 (PD) patients consisting of 716 FoG events. FoG-Finder beat the previous state-of-the-art, obtaining a 13.4% higher F1 score and 10.7% higher overall accuracy compared with other validated real-time FoG detection and treatment systems in a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. FoG-Finder also obtained an average treatment latency of 427ms and 615ms for subject-dependent and LOSO settings, respectively, proving FoG-Finder to be a viable FoG detection and treatment system for real-world use by PD patients.\n\nSecond, we further improved real-time FoG detection by identifying that turns are the most common aspect of non-FoG gait falsely identified by prior FoG detection systems as FoG, leading to treatment application when it is not needed.  To address this revelation, we designed the Gait-Guard wearable FoG detection and treatment system.  The system generates hand-crafted features derived from domain knowledge about the various ways that PD patients can express turns during non-FoG gait, and uses a light-weight multivariate time-series transformer model capable of real-time inference on mobile hardware to detect FoG symptoms. We evaluated Gait-Guard on a dataset we collected consisting of 26 PD patients and a total of 1591 FoG events. Gait-Guard was able to obtain a FoG event accuracy of 96.5% with a reduction in the false positive treatment rate of 112% compared to prior real-time FoG detection works including FoG-Finder. Gait-Guard is demonstrated to work for real-time treatments with an average FoG detection latency of just 378.5ms in a LOSO setting.\n\nThird, we are currently studying how real-time FoG detection models can be adapted to supply accurate FoG labels to automate the clinical FoG labeling process. We collected a FoG-rich dataset containing 41 PD patients while they walked through the five most common FoG triggering scenarios. We plan to combine a rules-based approach derived from domain knowledge about the FoG labeling process with machine learning to accurately provide start and end times to FoG time segments, something that no other research work has addressed.\n\nFinally, we will explore how wearable computing and machine learning can automatically detect and treat PD hand tremor symptoms in real-time, and leverage the real-time inference of our machine learning models to supply accurate hand tremor labels to clinicians in an offline setting. This will further improve how PD clinicians can monitor and treat their patients. Overall, we utilized wearable computing and machine learning to facilitate the detection and treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that combining wearable computing and machine learning can improve how PD clinicians monitor and treat their patients.\n\nBio:\nKenneth Howard Koltermann is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at William & Mary, under the supervision of Prof. Gang Zhou.
