# tribe-events

This is an app designed for William & Mary students (and faculty) to view on- and off-campus events displayed on an interactive map.

The web app is written in React with Ant Design components, and backed by an Express/Node server connected to a Postgres database. 
We have successfully deployed our application, including the frontend, backend, and database, all hosted on Render.
